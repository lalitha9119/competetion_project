# NLP Misconceptions Predictor

This project aims to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to predict student math misconceptions based on their open-ended responses. The model will be trained on a dataset of student questions, answers, and explanations, and will be evaluated on its ability to classify misconceptions accurately.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd nlp-misconceptions-predictor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   It is recommended to create a virtual environment before installing the dependencies. You can use `venv` or `conda` for this purpose.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Data Preparation**:
   Ensure that the `data` directory contains the `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `sample_submission.csv` files.

## Usage

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  Open the `notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb` notebook to perform exploratory data analysis on the training data.

- **Training the Model**:
  Run the `scripts/train.py` script to preprocess the data and train the NLP model. The trained model will be saved as `models/model.pkl`.

- **Making Predictions**:
  Use the `scripts/predict.py` script to load the trained model and make predictions on the test data. The predictions will be output in the required format.
